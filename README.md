In Marble Madness, the player has to navigate through a series of robot-infested mazes in
order to gather valuable crystals. After the player has gathered each of the crystals within
a particular maze, an exit will be revealed, and the player may then use the exit to
advance to the next maze. The player wins by completing all of the mazes. 

Make sure to install XQuartz if on macOS
